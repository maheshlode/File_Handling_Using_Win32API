# File_Handling_Using_Win32API

## File_Generator
This C++ program generates a 10MB file named "data.txt" filled with random alphabetic characters using the Win32 API. The program creates a file handle, dynamically allocates memory for the buffer, writes to the file, and then frees the allocated memory. To compile and execute the code, a Win32 project should be created in Visual Studio.

## Find_File_In_Directory
This code is a C++ program that searches for a file in a directory and its subdirectories using Windows API functions. It takes two command-line arguments: the directory path to search in, and the name of the file to search for. If the file is found, the program outputs the file's name and size. If the file is not found, the program outputs a message indicating that the file was not found.

To use this program, compile it using a C++ compiler, and run the executable with the two command-line arguments as mentioned above. The program will output the search results to the console.

## Search_File_WildCard_Option
This code is a C++ program that searches for a file in a directory using Windows API functions. It takes two command-line arguments: the directory path to search in, and the name of the file to search for (wildcard option allowed). If the file is found, the program outputs the file's name and size. If the file is not found, the program exits without any message.

To use this program, compile it using a C++ compiler, and run the executable with the two command-line arguments as mentioned above. The program will output the search results to the console.
