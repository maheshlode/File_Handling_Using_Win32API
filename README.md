# File_Handling_Using_Win32API

## File_Generator
This C++ program generates a 10MB file named "data.txt" filled with random alphabetic characters using the Win32 API. The program creates a file handle, dynamically allocates memory for the buffer, writes to the file, and then frees the allocated memory. To compile and execute the code, a Win32 project should be created in Visual Studio.
